R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.0 and R development
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win-Builder.

This version includes a fix requested by CRAN:
- Add vignettes/figure to .Rbuildignore 

In addition, this submission includes a fix for the DESCRIPTION file 
to quote non-words.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
