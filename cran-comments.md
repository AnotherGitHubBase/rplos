R CMD CHECK passed on my local OS X install on R 3.2.2 and R development
version, Ubuntu running on Travis-CI, and Win-Builder.

This submission is simply to bump requirement of solr v0.1.4 to v0.1.6
so that I can submit a new version of solr to CRAN.  I am making big 
changes in the solr package, so I don't want newer versions of the 
package to break this package.

Thanks! Scott Chamberlain
