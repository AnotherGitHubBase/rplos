rplos tutorial
=====

The `rplos` package interacts with the API services of [PLoS](http://www.plos.org/) (Public Library of Science) Journals. In order to use `rplos`, you need to obtain [your own key](http://api.plos.org/registration/) to their API services. Instruction for obtaining and installing keys so they load automatically when you launch R are on our GitHub Wiki page [Installation and use of API keys](https://github.com/ropensci/rOpenSci/wiki/Installation-and-use-of-API-keys).

This tutorial will go through three use cases to demonstrate the kinds
of things possible in `rplos`.

* Search across PLoS papers in various sections of papers
* Search for terms and visualize results as a histogram OR as a plot through time
* Text mining of scientific literature


## Load package from CRAN

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("rplos")
```


## Search across PLoS papers in various sections of papers

searchplos is a general search, and in this case searches for the term
**Helianthus** and returns the DOI's of matching papers

```{r load}
library(rplos)
```

```{r search1, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, comment=NA, cache=TRUE}
searchplos(terms = "Helianthus", fields = "id", limit = 5)
```

### plosauthor searches across the author fields at PLoS, and in this case returns the authors of the matching papers

```{r}
plosauthor(terms = "Eisen", fields = "author", limit = 10, results = "TRUE")
```

## Search for terms and visualize results as a histogram OR as a plot through time

plosword allows you to search for 1 to K words and visualize the results
as a histogram, comparing number of matching papers for each word

```{r}
out <- plosword(list("monkey", "Helianthus", "sunflower", "protein", "whale"), 
    vis = "TRUE")
out$table  # results in a data frame
```


```{r}
out$plot  # and the figure
```

## Visualize terms

`plot_througtime` allows you to search for up to 2 words and visualize the results as a line plot through time, comparing number of articles matching through time. Visualize with the ggplot2 package, only up to two terms for now.

```{r}
plot_throughtime(terms = "phylogeny", limit = 200, gvis = FALSE)
```

![...](tutorial_images/plothroughtime1.png)

```{r}
plot_throughtime(list("drosophila", "monkey"), 100)
```

![](tutorial_images/plothroughtime2.png)

### OR using google visualizations through the googleVis package, check it your self using, e.g.

```{r}
plot_throughtime(terms = list("drosophila", "flower"), limit = 200, gvis = TRUE)
```

...And a google visualization will render on your local browser and you
can play with three types of plots (point, histogram, line), all through
time. The plot is not shown here, but try it out for yourself!!
